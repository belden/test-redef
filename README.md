# Test::Redef ![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nearbuy/test-redef.png?branch=master)

Replace methods with test code, get feedback on how they are called
and put it all back together when your test is done.

## Examples

``` ruby
require 'test/unit'
require 'test/redef'

class Example < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_redef
    now = Time.at(1375654620).utc
    Test::Redef.rd(
      'Time.now' => proc { now },  # replace with the given proc
      'Time#sunday?' => :wiretap,  # instrument existing implementation
      'Kernel#raise' => :empty,     # replace with empty proc
    ) do |rd|
      assert( Time.now.sunday? )
      assert_nothing_raised { raise ArgumentError }

      assert_equal( [[ArgumentError]], rd[:raise].args )
      assert_equal( 1, rd[:sunday?].called )
      assert( rd[:now].called? )
    end
  end
engsd
```
